1. cater to two types of visitors:
	a. Members want:
		1) Access to Fit Rewards program tracking
		2) Access to their Account and Profile
	b. Prospective Member wants to see:
		1) Free Pass info
		2) Pricing info
		3) Location
		4) Hours
		5) Testimonials
		6) Services (personal training, classes)

2. Thing everyone wants to see:
	a. Class Schedule
	b. Trainers
	c. Newsletter Signup
	d. Forums
	e. Blog
	f. Contact information

3. Things that need to be clarified and/or fixed:
	1. ActiveTrax vs Fit Rewards? What is difference (if difference, what are each?) - What is "Personal Performance Programs" (is this ActiveTrax or Fit Rewards) - how is this tied in - where is it listed under services...
	2. SEO needs major work
	3. Linkage everywhere is completely messed up and needs fixing (for example: on home page they all link to "giantsgym.com" and go back to the home page)

4. Needs some coherence and excitement (www.crunch.com is a good example of a well-designed and thought out gym website - and boomfitness.com is a good example on their home page of making everything the prospective user would want to find in one place)
